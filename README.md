# CS 5381: Analysis of Algorithms - Project2

Topological orderings have many uses in our lives. For example, our day to day routine has been through a topological sort, or finding the order to take the courses is also considered a topological ordering problem. In this project, we implement a topological ordering algorithm by using Depth First Search (DFS) to determine an order for taking courses in the university.
